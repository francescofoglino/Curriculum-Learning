# Curriculum-Learning
Code for the experiments of the paper "Curriculum Learning for Cumulative Return Maximization" published in IJCAI19.

The code is divided into three different parts:
- Block Dude and Gridworld: this folder contains the java code relative to the experiments in the two simulated environmnets "Block Dude" and "Gridworld". All this code is based on the library BURLAP (http://burlap.cs.brown.edu/)
- Combinatorial Optimization Algorithms: this folder contains the implementation of the different combinatorial optimization algorithms against which our proposed algorithm (HTS-CR) is compared in the above mentioned paper
- MGEnv: this folder contains all the code relative to the real-world experiments. MGEnv is a simulated micro-grid domain modeled out of real data from the PecanStreet Inc. database.
